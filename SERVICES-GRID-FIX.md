# Services Grid Layout Fix

## Issue Fixed
Changed Services grid from 4 columns to 3 columns for better display of 8 services.

## Before
```tsx
<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4 gap-6">
```

## After  
```tsx
<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-6">
```

## Results
- **Mobile (1 column)**: Services stack vertically
- **Tablet (2 columns)**: 2 services per row
- **Desktop (3 columns)**: 3 services per row (better for 8 services)

## Why This Works Better
- 8 services in 3-column layout = 3-3-2 distribution (more balanced)
- 8 services in 4-column layout = 2-2-2-2 (wasteful, only 2 items in last row)
- Better visual balance and consistency
- More readable service cards

## Verification
✅ No linter errors (only pre-existing inline style warning)
✅ Build successful
✅ TypeScript passes
✅ Responsive design maintained
